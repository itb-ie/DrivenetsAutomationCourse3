f = open("text.txt", "r")  # opening for reading is the default way!

# print(f.read())  # read will give you all the information inside the file!

# next we read it line by line! the file descriptor is iterable!!!
for line in f:
    # there is a new line in the text file and also print adds a new line. so that is why we have double new lines
    # print(f"line: {line}", end="")
    print(f"line: {line.rstrip()}")
